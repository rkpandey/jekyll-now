Generalist Backend Software Engineer who has worked with a vast number of technologies, and yet still retain the same passion and drive for learning new things as I did when I took my first programming class in college.
My concentration has primarily in the enterprise application industry working on the most difficult serverside challenges of the time. I thrive in the fast-pace of constant change and challenge.
